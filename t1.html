    <p style="color: red;">My name is S. Gopinath, and I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology at VELS University. I’ve also completed a Diploma in Computer Technology, which gave me a solid foundation in computer basics and logical thinking.

Right now, I’m focused on becoming a Full Stack Java Developer, and I’m actively building my skills in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and front-end basics. I also regularly practice aptitude and problem-solving, as I’m preparing to enter the IT industry.

I recently applied for internships, including one in R&D for Connect Perforation, which aligns with my interest in exploring real-time problem-solving and technical documentation.

I’m a quick learner, a team player, and someone who enjoys taking up challenges to grow in the tech field. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself."
